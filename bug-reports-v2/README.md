# Bug Reports API Implementation

What is **Bug Report**? A bug report is a specific report that outlines information about what is wrong and needs fixing within App. The report lists reasons, or seen errors, to point out exactly what is viewed as wrong, and also includes a request and/or details for how to address each issue. [References](https://bugherd.com/blog/bug-reporting/#:~:text=A%20bug%20report%20is%20a,how%20to%20address%20each%20issue.)

How is that **important**? Bug reporting helps smooth out software, so that it does what it needs to, without frustrating the people using it. Nobody wants to work with software that doesn’t behave as expected. It’s a terrible user experience. [References](https://bugherd.com/blog/bug-reporting/)
