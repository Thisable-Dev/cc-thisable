# Thisable - Cloud Identity Platform Documentation

What is **Cloud Identity Platform**? Identity Platform is a customer identity and access management (CIAM) platform that helps organizations add identity and access management functionality to their applications, protect user accounts, and scale with confidence on Google Cloud.

Identity Platform can help protect your app’s users and prevent account takeovers by offering multi-factor authentication (MFA) and integrating with Google’s intelligence for account protection. [References](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform)
