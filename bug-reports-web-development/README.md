# Bug Reports API Implementation

What is **Bug Report**? A bug report is a specific report that outlines information about what is wrong and needs fixing within Application. The report lists reasons, or seen errors, to point out exactly what is viewed as wrong, and also includes a request and/or details for how to address each issue. [References](https://bugherd.com/blog/bug-reporting/#:~:text=A%20bug%20report%20is%20a,how%20to%20address%20each%20issue.)

How is that **important**? Bug reporting helps smooth out Application, so that it does what it needs to, without frustrating the people using it. Nobody wants to work with software that doesn’t behave as expected. It’s a terrible user experience. [References](https://bugherd.com/blog/bug-reporting/)

In this project, I made Bug Reports API with **RESTful API** method and Authentication API Caller using **Hapi-auth-jwt** and **jsonwebtoken**. Deploy the code to **VM Instance** and store the request body data json to **Firestore Database**
